# Test Discs #
This folder contains sample ISO images of different disc types to use for library testing.

These ISO images are not valid images, and do not contain valid video files. They each contain:
- 8 video files (named correctly for the media type, e.g., VOB for DVD).
- Each video file consists of the values 0-255 in ascending order, repeating for the length of the file.
- Each video file is 1MiB in size.
- There are 8 video files per ISO image.
